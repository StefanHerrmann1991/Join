                Join is a drag and drop kanban board. It is used for project management and task organization. With this
                type
                of board, you can visually represent the different stages of a project or workflow, and then drag and
                drop
                tasks between those stages as they are completed.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Join consists of several columns representing different stages of a project, such as "To Do," "In
                    Progress,", "Awaiting Feedback" and "Done". </li>
                <li>You can create a new task by clicking on the "Add Task" selector in the menu or by simply adding
                    tasks
                    at the board using the plus symbol or the "Add Task"-Button.</li>
                <li>Drag and drop tasks between columns: Once you have tasks on your board, you can easily move them
                    between
                    columns as their status changes. To do this, simply click and hold the task you want to move, and
                    then
                    drag it to the column where you want it to go.</li>
                <li>Edit task details: You can edit task details by clicking on the task card. You can change the task
                    name,
                    add a description, assign a due date, assign users or add subtasks to help organize your board.</li>
                <li>Archive completed tasks: When a task is completed, you can archive it to keep your board clean and
                    organized. Simply click on the task card and move it to the "Done" board.</li>
                <li>Collaborate with others: If you're working on a project with others, you can invite them to view and
                    edit your kanban board. This allows everyone to stay on the same page and keep track of progress in
                    real-time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                That's it! With these steps, you should be able to create and use a drag and drop Join to manage
                your projects and tasks effectively.
